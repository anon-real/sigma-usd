    [AgeUSD protocol](https://ergoplatform.org/en/blog/2021-02-05-building-ergo-how-the-ageusd-stablecoin-works/).
    The foundation on which a new era of digital finance will be built.

    Its economic model designed in partnership between IOHK, Ergo, and Emurgo maintains the conservative settings
    for collateral reserves and avoids the need for liquidations.
    Along with that, it supports a fully decentralised stablecoin emission setup.
    Thus, SigmaUSD will offer the world a stable, simple, and decentralised stablecoin.

sigmausd-vs-oracle:
  q: Why is the value of SigmaUSD different than exchanges/CoinMarketCap/etc ?
  a: |-
    The USD value of SigmaUSD is determined by the [ERG-USD Oracle Pool](https://explorer.ergoplatform.com/en/oracle-pool-state/ergusd).
    The Oracle updates every 12 minutes and can only increase/decrease by up to a fixed percentage so the price will fluxuate
    much sporatically than exchanges that update contintually.

refunds:
  q: What do I do if my refund gets "stuck"?
  a: |-
    Transactions can fail when the oracle refreshes during (and the price changes).
    In this event the funds will be returned to your connected wallet. 

    Use this [link](#/refund) to request a refund anytime if your funds become "stuck" in a proxy address.
